# Proof of Execution

Place the required artifacts here before submission. Keep filenames simple
and self-descriptive so graders can quickly verify the evidence.

## Screenshots (mandatory)
- Gmail inbox showing the unread messages used for the demo.
- Google Sheet showing rows added by the script (at least 5 rows preferred).
- OAuth consent screen (optional: blur personal details).

Suggested filenames:
- gmail_unread.png
- sheet_rows.png
- oauth_consent.png

## Video (mandatory)
Provide a 2–3 minute demo video that covers:
- High-level project flow (Gmail → parsing → Sheets).
- How `Processed` prevents duplicates and what the spreadsheet state
	looks like before/after a run.
- Demonstrate running the script twice to show idempotency.

Suggested filename: demo.mp4
